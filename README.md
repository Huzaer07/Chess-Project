# Chess Project

This is my AQA Computer Science NEA project: a player vs AI chess game built using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The game allows a human player to play against an AI opponent

Key Features:

Built using WPF for a smooth and interactive GUI.

AI opponent that mirrors the player's skill level by adapting to their moves.

Fully object-oriented design with separate classes for each chess piece, the board, and AI logic.




This project is aimed at making chess more accessible and trackable, especially in settings where physical pieces can be lost or misplaced, such as school clubs.
